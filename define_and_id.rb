# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:


"Hello World".include?("Hello")
- puts "The include? method is called on the string object 'Hello World' to determine if it contains the string argument defined as 'Hello'.When called it should return a boolean value (true or false) in this case it should return 'true'"

"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")
- puts "The .end_with? method is being called on the string object 'Hello World'to determine if it ends with the string argument 'Hello'. When called it should return a boolean value of 'false'"

"Hello World".end_with?("rld")
- puts "Here the .end_with? method is called on the same string objest as before but using a different argument. This time when it's called it will return a boolean value of 'tru' because the strong object ended with 'rld'"

12.even?
- puts "The .even? method is used on an integer 12 and when called returns a boolean response of true (if the integer was even) and false (if the integer was odd). There must be an integer for it to work. Here it would return the output of true."

18.next
- puts "The .next is called on the integer 18 and returns the integer but adds 1. For example 18.next would return the output of 19."

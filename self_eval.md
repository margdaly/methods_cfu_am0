# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
    - Figuring out what they do has been a bit tricky which is surprising to me! Usually what they do is in their name but I've had to run them a few times and look a lot of them up to be sure. I prefer making up new ones.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
    - I feel good about righting simple methods but getting more complicated when adding if and else statements into the mix.  It does remind me a lot of the logical reasoning questions so I'm confident I'll soon be less confused.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
    - I'm still confused on when to use puts in a method and when it is not needed?
